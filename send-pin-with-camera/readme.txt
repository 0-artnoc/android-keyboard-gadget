An app to crack a PIN code, when the target system loses keypresses (happens in MacOS BIOS).

It uses camera to check if each keypress is recognized.

You have to align your phone camera so that blue circles will match positions of PIN code digits on the screen.

This app does not work on Lollipop, only on Android 4.X.
To modify amount of digits in PIN code, change variable PIN_LENGTH inside MainActivity.java and recompile this app.
