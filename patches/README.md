Please read [DEVICES_AND_THEIR_KERNELS.md](DEVICES_AND_THEIR_KERNELS.md) first
to find out your DEVICE_CODENAME, MANUFACTURER, SOC and KERNEL_VERSION (LOSK_VERS / MNFK_VERS). 
- First search for your device by its DEVICE_CODENAME in by-device-codename. 
- If you can't find your device patch by its DEVICE_CODENAME, search for your device by its MANUFACTURER+SOC combination in by-soc-and-manufacturer
- If you can't find your device patch by its SOC+MANUFACTURER combo, search for a suitable KERNEL_VERSION patch in by-kernel-version

If you have problems / would like to create an issue, consult [CONTRIBUTING_AND_ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md](CONTRIBUTING_AND_ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)!
