Please first read CONTRIBUTING_AND_ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md and do some research about your device! 

I will close your issue without answering if you don't provide me enough information about...
1. your device (DEVICE_CODENAME, KERNEL_VERSION, etc.)
2. what is not working
3. what exactly you would like to have / do.
